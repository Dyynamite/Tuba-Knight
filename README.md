INTRODUCTION
------------

Tuba Knight is a game ran on Unity Engine.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

A Windows or Mac machine with the ability to run a x32 bit application is required in order to play Tuba Knight.

INSTALLATION
------------

Windows:
In this folder is a file called "Tuba Knight." You can run this file in order to run the game, or you can right click and select "create shortcut" in order to create a shortcut file which you can move to your desktop. This new file can run the application as well.

Mac:
In this folder is a file called "Tuba Knight." You can run this file in order to run the game, or you can drag it to your desktop for easier access.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Game does not load:
The game may not load if your machine is either incapable of running the application (which is unlikely), or if your computer is attempting to run the wrong version of the application. Verify that you have downloaded the version that correctly corresponds to your machine. If your system does not meet the listed requirements, then you will not be able to run the application.

Windows shortcut does not work:
The shortcut may no longer work if the application's directory changes. If it does, then simply create a new shortcut.
